## About:
This project is about a dataset of the westbound traffic on the [I-94 Interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94).

## Note:
John Hogue made the dataset available, and you can download it from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume).

## Goals:
The aim of this project is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.

## Technologies:
Project is created with:
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
