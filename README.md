## About:
This project is about a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a [classifieds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website. The dataset was originally [scraped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) and uploaded to Kaggle by user [orgesleka](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka).
The original dataset isn't available on Kaggle anymore, but you can find it [here](https://data.world/data-society/used-cars-data).

## Note:
A few modifications from the original dataset:

- We sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure your code runs quickly in our hosted environment
- We dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what you would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)

## Goals:
The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

## Technologies:
Project is created with:
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
